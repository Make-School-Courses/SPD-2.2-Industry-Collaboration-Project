## 📖 [15m] Overview

Web analytics is the process of analyzing the behavior of visitors to a Web site. The use of Web analytics is said to enable a business to attract more visitors, retain or attract new customers for goods or services, or to increase the dollar volume each customer spends.

### Developer Analytics 101

- **A/B Testing**: A/B testing (also known as split testing or bucket testing) is a method of comparing two versions of a webpage or app against each other to determine which one performs better.
- **Heatmaps**: Heatmaps can be used to show where users have clicked on a page, how far they have scrolled down a page, or used to display the results of eye-tracking tests.
- **Tracking Pixels**: A tracking pixel is an HTML code snippet which is loaded when a user visits a website or opens an email. It is useful for tracking user behavior and conversions. With a tracking pixel, advertisers can acquire data for online marketing, web analysis or email marketing.
- **Event Tracking**: Event tracking is a useful feature that allows you to record interactions with elements of your website which aren't tracked as standard within the product. Think of them as custom, trackable events.

## 💻 [15m] Activity: What Will You Track?

Write down all the different things that can happen in a specific personal project of your choice.

**Write down every event you can think of for your project and app.** We will learn how to track these metrics after the break!
